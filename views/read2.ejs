                <p>Artificial Intelligence is no longer confined to science fiction — it's now shaping our classrooms.
                    From intelligent tutoring systems to automated grading and personalized learning experiences, AI is
                    making education smarter and more accessible.

                    One of the biggest benefits of AI in education is adaptability. Students no longer need to fit into
                    a one-size-fits-all model. AI can assess a learner’s strengths and weaknesses, adjusting content in
                    real time to suit individual needs.

                    For teachers, AI reduces the burden of repetitive tasks. Grading multiple-choice exams, managing
                    attendance, and even detecting plagiarism can be handled by intelligent systems.

                    However, the integration of AI isn’t without its challenges. There are concerns about data privacy,
                    over-reliance on machines, and the potential loss of human connection in the classroom.

                    The future of education lies in finding the right balance. AI should augment teachers, not replace
                    them. By combining the efficiency of machines with the empathy of educators, we can create a system
                    that’s truly student-centered.

                    In this rapidly changing world, learning how to learn will be the most important skill — and AI can
                    help us master it.
